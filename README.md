# CS765StudentVis

This repository holds the `ui.R` and `server.R` files necessary to run the Shiny App created for the final design challenge in CS 765: Data Visualization.

Additionally, the shiny app can be found [here](https://bgstieber.shinyapps.io/CS765StudentVis/).

This project first reads in a JSON file, performs some manipulation to get the data in a _tidy_ format, and then creates some standard visualizations to allow for interactive exploration of a student gradebook data set.
